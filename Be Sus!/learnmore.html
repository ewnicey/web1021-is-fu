    The global temperature has already risen 1.1ºC above the pre-industrial level, with glaciers
    melting and the sea level rising. Impacts of climate change also includes flooding and drought,
    displacing millions of people, sinking them into poverty and hunger, denying them access to 
    basic services, such as health and education, expanding inequalities, stifling economic growth
    and even causing conflict. By 2030, an estimated 700 million people will be at risk of 
    displacement by drought alone.<br>

    Taking urgent action to combat climate change and its devastating impacts is therefore an 
    imperative to save lives and livelihood,and key to making the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
    Development and its 17 Goals,a reality.<br>

    In 2020, concentrations of global greenhouse gases reached new highs, and real-time data
    point to continued increases. As these concentrations rise, so does the Earth's temperature.
    In 2021, the global mean temperature was about 1.1°C above the pre-industrial level
    (from 1850 to 1900). The years from 2015 to 2021 were the seven warmest on record.<br>

    To limit warming to 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as set out in the Paris Agreement,
    global greenhouse gas emissions will need to peak before 2025. Then they must decline by 43 percent
    by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. Countries are articulating climate action plans to cut emissions
    and adapt to climate impacts through nationally determined contributions. However, current national
    commitments are not sufficient to meet the 1.5°C target.

    Sustainability improves the quality of our lives, protects our ecosystem and preserves natural
    resources for future generations. In the corporate world, sustainability is associated with an
    organization's holistic approach, taking into account everything, from manufacturing to logistics
    to customer service. Going green and sustainable is not only beneficial for the company; it also
    maximizes the benefits from an environmental focus in the long-term.

    It's actually very easy to opt for sustainable products these days.Tons of companies make sustainability
    a priority. From clothing, to beauty brands, to food and energy companies. There are so many sustainable
    options to choose from. So choose brands that make sustainability a top priority. Choose brands that use
    recycled plastic or materials rather than brands that continuously add to the landfills. If you are a
    business owner yourself, careful planning across your business processes can help you stop sending waste
    to landfills. Businesses can take a lot of simple steps to achieve more sustainable practices, such as
    using bamboo instead of disposable plastic cutlery, replacing fluorescent tubes with LED bulbs, and
    hiring waste treatment contractors, etc.
